KITE-MALLORCA is located in Sa Marina, the beach in the bay between Alcudia and Port de Pollenca northeast of the island.

We've for you:  
- Lessons for all kite levels (beginners, refreshers and advanced riders),  
- Kites, Boards, etc. for kiteboarders to rent,  
- Storage for our guests,  
- and much more...

## Kiteboarding and kitesurfing courses
As an absolute beginner you normally need about 10 hours of lessons to control the kite, do the first water-start attempts and ride the first meters so that you can then go into a rental and continue to practice independently under our supervision.

{% include carousel.html %}

The lessons for refreshers or advanced riders fully depend on the individual level of the kiter. Regardless of whether keeping height, going upwind, doing basic turns, jibe or first jumps - the instructor follows your needs and brings you to the next kite level!
